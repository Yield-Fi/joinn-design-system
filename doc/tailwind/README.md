# Installing Joinn Design System

This README provides instructions for integrating the **Joinn Design System** with **Tailwind CSS** in your project. The system outputs ready-to-use CSS files (for base and dark modes) plus a `tailwind.config.js`, ensuring consistent theming with minimal setup.

---

## 1. Obtain the Generated Artifacts

The Joinn Design System repository uses **Style Dictionary** to produce **four** key outputs in **`build/tailwind/`**:

1. [**`base.css`**](https://github.com/Yield-Fi/joinn-design-system/blob/main/build/tailwind/base.css) – Contains global (light/base) CSS variables.
2. [**`dark.css`**](https://github.com/Yield-Fi/joinn-design-system/blob/main/build/tailwind/dark.css) – Contains dark-mode CSS variables (using a `.dark` selector).
3. [**`index.css`**](https://github.com/Yield-Fi/joinn-design-system/blob/main/build/tailwind/index.css) – Imports `base.css` and `dark.css` plus the Tailwind layers.
4. [**`tailwind.config.js`**](https://github.com/Yield-Fi/joinn-design-system/blob/main/build/tailwind/tailwind.config.js) – A Tailwind configuration file referencing the generated tokens.

You can **copy** these files directly from the Joinn Design System repo’s **`build/tailwind/`** folder into your own project or **consume** them in a package/bundler (depending on how you manage dependencies).

---

## 2. Place or Reference the Files in Your Tailwind Setup

1. [**`index.css`**](https://github.com/Yield-Fi/joinn-design-system/blob/main/build/tailwind/index.css)

   - This CSS file already imports `base.css` and `dark.css` at the top, then includes `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`.
   - By default, it's auto-included under `src/` in the Joinn Design System, but if you want to manually include it, place `index.css` in your project’s `src/` folder (or wherever your main stylesheet resides).

2. [**`tailwind.config.js`**](https://github.com/Yield-Fi/joinn-design-system/blob/main/build/tailwind/tailwind.config.js)
   - The config extends Tailwind with the Joinn tokens. It’s set to `darkMode: "class"`.
   - Place or reference this file as your primary Tailwind config when running your build or development server (e.g., `tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.js ...`).

### Example Project Structure

```bash
my-project/
  ├─ src/
  │   └─ index.css           <-- Copied from build/tailwind/index.css
  ├─ tailwind.config.js     <-- Copied from build/tailwind/tailwind.config.js
  └─ ...
```

## 3. Install Tailwind CSS and Necessary Dependencies

Ensure you have Tailwind CSS installed in your project. If not, you can install it using the following commands:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
```

If you're using a preconfigured `tailwind.config.js` from the Joinn Design System, replace the one generated by the above command with the `tailwind.config.js` file from the **Joinn Design System** repository.

---

## 4. Configure Your Project to Use the Joinn Design System

To integrate the design system:

1. Ensure `index.css` is included in your main entry file (e.g., `src/index.css` or equivalent).
2. Use the `tailwind.config.js` file provided by Joinn to replace your default Tailwind configuration.
3. Make sure your project’s build tool (e.g., Vite, Webpack, or Parcel) is correctly processing Tailwind CSS and PostCSS.

---

## 5. Add Dark Mode Support (Optional)

The Joinn Design System uses the `class` strategy for dark mode. To enable it in your project:

1. Add the `dark` class to your `html` or `body` tag to toggle dark mode.
2. Example:

   ```html
   <html class="dark">
     <body>
       <div class="text-primary">Hello, dark mode!</div>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   You can programmatically toggle this class using JavaScript or frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, based on user preferences.

---

## 6. Customize the Design System (Optional)

The `tailwind.config.js` file can be extended to include your custom configurations. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...require("./tailwind.config.js"),
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,html}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        customColor: "#ff5733",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

This ensures that you maintain the Joinn Design System's tokens while adding your own customizations.

---

## 7. Verify Your Setup

After completing the integration, verify that the design system is correctly applied by running your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Check your components to ensure that styles and tokens are being applied as expected.
